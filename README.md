# Suspect Recall

This web app uses Golang for the backend and React for the frontend.

## Installation

```
npm install
npm run start
```

View the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

This will start a dev server with live reload so that you can edit your go code in the `backend` and your React code in `frontend`.  `gin` handles reload for Golang and `watchify` handles it for React.
